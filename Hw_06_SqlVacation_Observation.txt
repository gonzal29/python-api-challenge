Observation #1:

When generating a city list and using the url and the designated API Key you are given the temperature
given is automatically taken in units of Kelvin in order to change that I needed to alter the query_url line of code I used
and add "&units=imperial" but that  must be added before "&q=" otherwise it won't work. From there you should notice the temperature
will change on the dataframes as well on how it looks in your scatter plot as well

Observation #2:

When creating the Northern and Southern hemisphere plots because you need to filter data rather than try to add adjustments to the plot
it's much easier to creater filtered dataframes instead and use rather than use the original dataframe you started with into the code and from
there just use [""] along with the keyword for what you want to take out such as Lat.

Observation #3: 

In case you don't understand why when using the linear regression model and you can't understand why the linear model doesn't appear on the graph
that's because the x and y values change and because you have to play with the line of code that says plt.annotate and alter the values given in (#,#) for this
it's suggested to play around with otherwise you may have your numbers appearing over values making it hard to read
